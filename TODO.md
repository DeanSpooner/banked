- Improve the loading state for the home screen, rather than just a simple string;
- If I get round to adding pull-to-refresh, I may want a modal to confirm the user wants to do this if they have any edited dates, as these will be deleted;
- Any of the extras in the `README.md`, if I can fit any in in the time constraints of the task;
- Tidy up and remove any of the final remaining template components that aren't needed or of any use at all, e.g. `collapsible.tsx`.
