This is a file containing the general process of me making the Banked app - this is likely going to follow my commits from this point:

1. Created RN/Expo app (decided to use Expo as RN themselves recommend this as a framework, plus it's what I'm used to in my current job with the apps I work with);
2. General tidy-up from what `create-expo-app` created, removed most of the template components, utils etc., except for a couple related to theming that I may likely use in the future. Added a bit more structure for how I envisage this repo building out, and added an About tab just so I have multiple tabs - will use this, Home (`index.tsx`) and possibly a Settings tab in the future;
3. Created Zod schemas for the API, and each bank holiday. Starting to create functions (TDD with Jest) to process this data so it will eventually be an array of the next five unique bank holidays across the entirety of the UK. Starting with `mergeUkBankHolidays` to just merge the regions' bank holidays into one large array of all bank holidays, including duplicates;
4. Added test for `mergeUkBankHolidays` for when data is actually invalid (would expect Zod to throw an error in this case);
5. Added and implemented Husky as a pre-commit hook to run all tests at each commit, before I start adding any more tests. Purposefully broke one of the above tests to check it worked, which it did;
6. Added `removeDuplicateHolidays` function and tests to remove all duplicate bank holidays from a BankHoliday array;
7. Added `filterHolidaysOverSixMonthsAway` function and tests to remove all bank holidays that do not fall within the next six months, using `date-fns` package I read about on StackOverflow;
8. Added `processBankHolidays` function and tests, that combines the previous util functions I added, sorts the remaining bank holidays by date, then returns the first five results. Actually not too bad, the weight of the functionality had been done in the other utils (especially `filterHolidaysOverSixMonthsAway` and getting my head round `date-fns`). Used much larger data that I copied from the API and added it to a `mockData.ts` file - I may refactor one or two other tests to use this same data;
9. Added minor tests I forgot to add earlier to check that the boolean `isToday` is actually behaving properly in `filterHolidaysOverSixMonthsAway`;
10. Implemented simple fetching of the data using `processBankHolidays` directly in the main page for now. Also removed `axios` since I realised I didn't need it for a simple JSON GET request;
11. Factored fetching and state-setting into separate `useBankHolidays` custom hook;
12. Re-wrote the `README.md` to be more personalised and reflective of me and my other projects, as well as to note down current project progress and possible bonus ideas;
13. Noticed Expo's template had defaulted to locking the orientation of this app as portrait. I think either orientation should be allowed, so removed this from `app.json`. Added `expo-calendar` as a package in preparation for adding bank holidays to device calendars;
14. `addToCalendar` util function added, lifting, implementing and editing a lot of the example code from Expo docs seems to have worked really well - tested and confirmed I could add events to my calendars on my iPhone, iOS Simulator and Android Emulator (all via Expo Go - will see if these still work with development builds later), as well as checking it handled denied permissions as expected;
15. Created a couple of basic Pixelmator icons for the app, integrated these as the app icon, splash screen icon and web favicon, and updated `README.md` to use these;
16. Slight change to MaterialUI icons used in tabs, and rename of "Home" to "Calendar".
